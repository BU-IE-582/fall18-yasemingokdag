Sports forecasting is important for sports fans, team managers, sponsors, the media and the growing
number of punters who bet on online platforms. Widespread demand for professional advice regarding
the results of sporting events is met by a variety of expert forecasts, usually in the form of
recommendations from tipsters. In addition, betting odds offer a type of predictor and source of expert
advice regarding sports outcomes. Whereas fixed odds reflect the (expert) predictions of bookmakers,
the odds in pari-mutuel betting markets indicate the combined expectations of all punters, which
implies an aggregated expert prediction.

Expert forecasts of sport outcomes often come from so-called ‘tipsters’, whose predictions appear in
sports journals or daily newspapers. Tipsters are usually independent experts who do not apply a formal
model but rather derive their predictions from their experience or intuition. They generally provide
forecasts for only a specific selection of games, often related to betting. No immediate financial
consequences result from the predictions of tipsters. Empirical evidence regarding the forecast
accuracy of tipsters shows that their ability is limited.

This project is about understanding the behavior of different betting companies and leagues with the
use of available information from different sources (odds from different betting companies, team status
and etc.).
